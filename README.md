//WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WINDOW, SCREEN, AND DOCUMENT IN JAVA SCRIPT:
WINDOW:
    In JavaScript, window, screen, and document are global objects that provide access to different parts of the web browser's environment. Here's a breakdown of each:

### window
The window object represents the browser's window or frame. It is the top-level object in the browser's hierarchy and serves as the global context for all JavaScript code running in a web page.

- *Properties and Methods*: It provides a wide range of properties and methods to interact with the browser, such as:
  - window.alert(): Displays an alert dialog.
  - window.setTimeout(): Calls a function after a specified delay.
  - window.location: Provides access to the URL of the current document and allows navigation.
  - window.history: Provides access to the browser's session history.
  - window.localStorage and window.sessionStorage: Allow storage of data locally in the browser.

### screen
The screen object contains information about the user's screen, such as its size, resolution, and color depth.

- *Properties*: It includes properties like:
  - screen.width: The width of the screen in pixels.
  - screen.height: The height of the screen in pixels.
  - screen.availWidth: The width of the screen, excluding interface features like the Windows Taskbar.
  - screen.availHeight: The height of the screen, excluding interface features.
  - screen.colorDepth: The number of bits used to display one color.

### document
The document object represents the web page loaded in the browser window. It is part of the window object and provides access to the content of the HTML document.

- *Properties and Methods*: It includes methods and properties to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), such as:
  - document.getElementById(): Selects an element by its ID.
  - document.querySelector(): Selects the first element that matches a CSS selector.
  - document.createElement(): Creates a new HTML element.
  - document.body: Represents the <body> element of the document.
  - document.title: Gets or sets the title of the document.

### Summary
- *window*: Represents the browser window; provides global functions and properties to interact with the browser environment.
- *screen*: Represents the physical screen; provides properties related to screen dimensions and color depth.
- *document*: Represents the HTML document loaded in the window; provides methods and properties to interact with and manipulate the document content.

These objects are essential for creating dynamic and interactive web pages by allowing scripts to interact with the browser and the loaded content."# DAY-5-TASK"
